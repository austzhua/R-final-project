## About Me
Hi! My name is **Austin Zhuang**, and I go to The Haverford School.

## About the Project
I chose to analyze how financial factors affect access to mental health using data
from IPUMS Health Surveys.

### Goals
* Visualize data on factors that affect mental health
  + Creating the correct labels that tell the clearest story
* Use visualizations to promote mental health awareness
