The four regions--Northeast, North Central/Midwest, South, and West--correspond to the U.S. regions recognized by the Census Bureau. Divisions and states included in the four regions are as follows:

Northeast:  New England Division (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and Middle Atlantic Division (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania)

North Central/Midwest: East North Central Division (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin) and West North Central Division (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska)

South: South Atlantic Division (Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida), East South Central Division (Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama), and West South Central Division (Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana)

West: Pacific Division (Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, and Hawaii) and Mountain Division (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada).

      <txt><![CDATA[PERWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files.  This weight should be used for many analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the selection of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 
&nbsp;Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

      <txt><![CDATA[POORYN indicates whether family income was above or below poverty level.  The poverty status of a family group is assigned to each member of the family, thus making POORYN a person-level variable.  Poverty status is also calculated for adults who live alone or with persons they are not related to; in such cases, POORYN is calculated based on the individual's income.   

Data Collection

Respondents were asked to look at a card listing broad income categories and to identify the category that most closely matched their family's before-tax total combined money income from all sources during the preceding calendar year.  
&nbsp;Total combined family income included the respondent's own income plus the income of all co-resident family members, including cohabiting partners and related armed forces members living at home.  It did not include the value of noncash benefits such as Food Stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, and public housing.To determine poverty status, the reported total family income was compared to the U.S. Census Bureau's poverty thresholds for the year in question.  These thresholds are based not only on income but also on family size and the number of children under age 18.  
&nbsp;If the reported family income figure was the same or higher than the poverty threshold for families of that size and age composition, the individual (and all members of the family) was considered "above poverty" and received a code of 1 in POORYN.  If the reported family income figure was less than the Census Bureau's poverty cut-off for families of that size and age composition, the individual (and all other members of the family) was classified as "poor" and received a code of 2 in POORYN.Basis of Poverty Definition&nbsp;Poverty data in IPUMS NHIS and in U.S. government statistics generally are based on a definition established by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently modified by Federal interagency committees in 1969 and 1980.  The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Directive 14 prescribes this definition as the official poverty measure for federal agencies to use in their statistical work.

At the core of this definition was the 1961 economy food plan, the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture.  It was determined from the Agriculture Department's 1955 survey of food consumption that families of three or more persons spend approximately one-third of their income on food; hence, the poverty level for these families was set at three times the cost of the economy food plan.  For smaller families and for persons living alone, the cost of the economy food plan was multiplied by factors that were slightly higher, to compensate for the relatively larger fixed expenses for these smaller households.  The federally established poverty thresholds are revised annually to allow for changes in the cost of living, as reflected in the Consumer Price Index.  The poverty thresholds are the same for all parts of the country; they are not adjusted for regional, state, or local variations in the cost of living.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[AEFFORT reports responses to the question, "During the past 30 days, how often did you feel that everything was an effort?"   

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 stated that the meaning of "everything" was respondent defined. At the beginning of the section of the survey devoted to evaluating nonspecific psychological distress, interviewers stated, "Now I am going to ask you some questions about feelings you may have experienced over the past 30 days."  They then handed respondents a flashcard listing five categories (all of the time; most of the time; some of the time; a little of the time; none of the time), from which respondents were to select the appropriate response.  The Manual for 1997-2000 directed the interviewer to "reread the question, emphasizing the wording of the answer categories," if the respondent gave an answer that did not match these categories.

Related Variables

AEFFORT is one of a series of six variables whose responses can be summed as a scale measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period.  This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.  
&nbsp;Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)

Nervous? (ANERVOUS)

Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)

Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)

That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)

Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)
As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."Scoring Variables&nbsp;Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of the six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time").  The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress.  According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.

To assist researchers who intend to sum responses to the variables included in the K6 Scale, IPUMS NHIS assigns codes that are consistent with Kessler's advised scoring system (i.e., with "none of the time" coded as 0 and "all of the time" coded as 4).  To produce valid results, users must exclude not in universe cases (persons other than sample adults, code 6 in IPUMS NHIS) and unknown cases (codes 7, 8, and 9 in IPUMS NHIS) before summing the responses.Follow-up Questions&nbsp;As a follow-up to the K6 Scale questions, the NHIS included a question that was not part of Kessler's original survey instrument.   All sample adults who answered "some of the time," "most of the time," or "all of the time" to any of the six questions included in the Kessler 6 Scale were asked, "Altogether, how much did these feelings interfere with your life or activities: a lot, some, a little, or not at all?" (AFEELINT1MO).   In 1999, additional follow-up questions collected further information about how "these feelings" affected the person (see FBADHOWOFT, FBADMORE, FBADLESS, FBADUNABLE, and FBADCUTDOWN).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[ANERVOUS reports responses to the question, "During the past 30 days, how often did you feel nervous?"   

At the beginning of the section of the survey devoted to evaluating nonspecific psychological distress, interviewers stated, "Now I am going to ask you some questions about feelings you may have experienced over the past 30 days."  They then handed respondents a flashcard listing five categories (all of the time; most of the time; some of the time; a little of the time; none of the time), from which respondents were to select the appropriate response.  The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000 directed the interviewer to "reread the question, emphasizing the wording of the answer categories," if the respondent gave an answer that did not match these categories.

Related Variables

ANERVOUS is one of a series of six variables whose responses can be summed as a scale measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period.  This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.  
&nbsp;Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)

Nervous? (ANERVOUS)

Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)

Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)

That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)

Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)
As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."Scoring Variables&nbsp;Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of these six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time").  The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress.  According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.

To assist researchers who intend to sum responses to the variables included in the K6 Scale, IPUMS NHIS assigns codes that are consistent with Kessler's advised scoring system (i.e., with "none of the time" coded as 0 and "all of the time" coded as 4).  To produce valid results, users must exclude not in universe cases (persons other than sample adults, code 6 in IHIS) and unknown cases (codes 7, 8, and 9 in IHIS) before summing the responses.Follow-up Questions&nbsp;As a follow-up to the K6 Scale questions, the NHIS included a question that was not part of Kessler's original survey instrument.   All sample adults who answered "some of the time," "most of the time," or "all of the time" to any of the six questions included in the Kessler 6 Scale were asked, "Altogether, how much did these feelings interfere with your life or activities: a lot, some, a little, or not at all?" (AFEELINT1MO).   In 1999, additional follow-up questions collected further information about how "these feelings" affected the person (see FBADHOWOFT, FBADMORE, FBADLESS, FBADUNABLE, and FBADCUTDOWN).]]></txt>
